# Hello, visitor! ðŸ«¡

Working on projects using the most well-known technologies such as React, SASS/SCSS, Styled Components, among others.\
I am looking for an opportunity in the job market as frontend

## Recently created projects (`The ones that are worth it in my opinion)`

The projects below gave me a certain pride, I learned a lot from them and I feel that with each step things get better.\
Maybe they're not the best of the best, but that's what was thought of and that's how it should be.
